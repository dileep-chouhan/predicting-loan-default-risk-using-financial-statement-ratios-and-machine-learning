# Predicting Loan Default Risk using Financial Statement Ratios and Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Python-based model for predicting loan default risk.  By analyzing key financial statement ratios, the model helps financial institutions make more informed lending decisions and mitigate potential losses. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using appropriate machine learning techniques.  The resulting model provides a probability score indicating the likelihood of a loan defaulting.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* (Add any other libraries used here)


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** Execute `python main.py`

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC).  Additionally, the project may generate visualizations such as:

* Plots illustrating the relationships between key financial ratios and loan default.  (e.g., a scatter plot showing the correlation between debt-to-equity ratio and default probability).
* (Add any other example output files generated)
